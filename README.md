Hey, I'm Kusum, a  AI & MLstudent with a knack for web development and a desire to solve issues and problems out there. 

👨‍💻 In technical terms, I have a good foundation in  React.js, Node.js. Back-end being my recent exploration, I have limited knowledge of it. I am more proficient in front-end development with React.js.

✒️ 🅳🆂🅰: I have basic to intermediate knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms. This subject has given me insight into the importance of an effective algo in various programming scenarios.

⚙️ 🅼🅻: I have also explored Machine Learning fundamentals with Python - data collection, visualizing them with AI models. I found the codes to be of the same pattern, though the theory and the understanding of datasets are the parts which demand attention.

🧾 AI & ML: Among my ML subjects, my strengths are OOP (Object Oriented Programming) with Java , ML and Cloud Computing. Apart from that, I have found myself interested in  Operating Systems,DBMS.

🔍 Currently 𝘀𝗲𝗲𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 where I can apply and further develop my skills in web development. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects. Open for discussion of new technologies and using them in impactful projects.

Let's connect and reach out to each other to explore how we can create impactful solutions in the world with problems lurking around!
